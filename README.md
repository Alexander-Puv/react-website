# Welcome to my website, featuring a variety of blogs.
With a profile, you can customize your account information and leave comments on blog posts. I built this site using localStorage to store data. Although I didn't implement a feature for publishing new blogs, the comment function works similarly through localStorage. If you'd like to see my skills in working with backend technologies, check out my [notes app](https://github.com/Alexander-Puv/ReactTS-Notes) (which uses dexie) and [calendar app](https://github.com/Alexander-Puv/Calendar) (which uses JSON)\
This app created using React, React-Router-Dom, Mantine UI, and SCSS
