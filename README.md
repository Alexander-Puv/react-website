# This is a big website with blogs.
You can create a profile, change the info inside, add a comment to a blog etc.
I created it using localStorage. I didn't make the realisation of posting blogs but comments are pretty the same if we are doing it with localStorage. For submitting my skills in interaction with backend check [this notes app](https://github.com/Alexander-Puv/ReactTS-Notes) (here I used dexie) and [this calendar app](https://github.com/Alexander-Puv/Calendar) (here I used JSON)\
This app created using React, React-Router-Dom, Mantine UI, and SCSS
